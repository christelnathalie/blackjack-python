# 🃏 Blackjack Project - Python

Welcome to my very first **capstone project** built in Python: a **command-line Blackjack game**!

You can play directly in your browser here:

## 🎮 Objective

The goal of the game is to beat the computer by getting as close as possible to **21 points**, without going over.

You can:
- **Draw a card** or **pass your turn**
- Aces count as **11 or 1** depending on your score
- The game detects **natural Blackjacks**
- The computer **automatically draws** until it reaches at least 17

## 💻 Features

- Automatic card distribution
- Ace handling (**11 or 1**)
- Real-time score calculation
- Dynamic result messages
- Option to **replay as many times as you want**
- Clear display of player and computer scores

## 🧠 What I Learned

- List manipulation
- Functions (`def`, `return`)
- `while` loops and conditional logic
- User interaction using `input()`
- Algorithmic thinking (Ace logic, win conditions, etc.)

## 🚀 Run the Game

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackjack-python.git
   cd blackjack-python
